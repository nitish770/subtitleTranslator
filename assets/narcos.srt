18
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:21,305
[phone squeaking]

19
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:24,225
[man speaking Spanish]
What's up, Lizard?

20
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:27,603
We're going out tonight.

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,944
[narrator] And once you got a signal,
you didn't know who you were listening to.

22
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,614
That's why back then, the US government
developed software that could identify

23
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,158
- the voices of our targets.
- [indistinct chatter on headphones]

24
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:45,371
I got Poison at 400 to 1700 megahertz,
gentlemen.

25
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:48,499
And you guessed it:
no GPS either.

26
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,960
Hammer, prepare to engage.

27
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:54,463
[narrator] Once we got a target,
we still had to locate it.

28
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:58,300
So we had to triangulate their signals
using assets on the ground.

29
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,720
[chatter in Spanish over headphones]

30
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:04,057
OK, he's in Modelia.
